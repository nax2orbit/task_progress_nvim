# Installation

This Plugin was created in an environment using LazyVim.
1. Place the file in the following path:
```

```

2. Open Neovim and run:
```
:Lazy sync
```
After that, the task progress will be displayed in your statusline (lualine).

# Usage

Both forms with and without spaces are supported.

```
-[] Incomplete task
-[ ] Incomplete task (with space)

-[X] Completed task

```

The statusline will show the progress, for example:
